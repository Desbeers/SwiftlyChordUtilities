# SwiftlyChordUtilities

## A Swift package to handle musical chords

![Icon](https://github.com/Desbeers/SwiftlyChordUtilities/raw/main/Images/icon.png)

This package is **not stable**

For now, for the guitar only.

- Show chord diagrams in a SwiftUI `View`
- Define customs chords
- Transpose chords
- Play the chords with MIDI
- SwiftUI 'bit and pieces' to alter the appearance of the chord diagram

See the Demo for details how to use the package.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
## Thanks

### ChordDefinition
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

I stole inspiration, code and the database from [Swifty Chords](https://github.com/BeauNouvelle/SwiftyGuitarChords) but still send my PR's upstairs as you should do with Open Souce projects!

The smart stuff is very much a *not complete* 'Swift Port' of [PyChord](https://github.com/yuma-m/pychord)

## In use

I use this package in my following projects:

- [Chord Provider](https://github.com/Desbeers/Chord-Provider)
- [Chords Database](https://github.com/Desbeers/Chords-Database); mainly written to check the chords database.

## Documentation

This package is pretty well documented with DocC.

In Xcode: `Product->Build Documentation`.
